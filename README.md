**Weather Forecast Application**

- This Weather Forecast application allows users to search for the current weather conditions and hourly forecasts for a specific location. It retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in aS interface.
#Features

**Current Weather**: Users can search for a city or provide a zip code to fetch the current weather conditions for that location. The application displays various weather details such as temperature, weather description, wind speed, humidity, rain volume, snow volume, and cloud percentage. It also provides an appropriate background image based on the weather conditions.

**Hourly Forecast**: The application fetches the hourly weather forecast for the searched location. It displays the weather conditions for the next 15hours, including the time, weather icon, and temperature.

**Random City**: Upon loading the application, a random city is fetched from a predefined list, and its current weather and hourly forecast are displayed. This feature provides a quick glance at the weather in various cities.
